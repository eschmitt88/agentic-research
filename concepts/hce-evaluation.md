# hce-evaluation

## Definition

Hidden Consistent Evaluation: a strict separation between a
validation split the search loop reads on every iteration
(`metrics.json`) and a test split that is revealed only at chain
end by a final-scoring pass (`final_metrics.json`). The discipline
prevents autonomous loops from overfitting to their own search signal
across many cycles.

## Why it matters

AIRA_2 ([[literature/papers/hambardzumyan2026aira]]) names
validation-based selection overfitting as one of three dominant
bottlenecks in AI research agents, alongside synchronous execution
and weak fixed LLM operators. The fix is not a better metric but a
structural rule: the search loop must never read the test split.
AIRA_2's ablations show that without HCE, longer runs trade real
capability for validation-signal gaming, and the gap between
validation and held-out test metrics diverges.

MLE-bench ([[literature/papers/chan2024mle]]) provides the venue where
this bites hardest — Kaggle-sized competitions with enough iteration
headroom for the overfitting to compound.

## Implementation guidance

Any project that imports this concept should:

1. **Two metric files per experiment.** `metrics.json` holds
   validation-split numbers — this is the search signal. Every
   ranking skill reads it. `final_metrics.json` holds test-split
   numbers; only the final-scoring pass writes it.

2. **`test/` is off-limits during search.** Skills that touch
   experiment state (`/propose`, `/implement`, `/iterate`, `/expand`,
   `/ensemble`, `/new-experiment`) must not read, list, glob, or
   sample from `test/`. This is enforced by `~/.claude/rules/evaluation.md`
   and surfaced by `/lint` as a hard failure.

3. **Consistent splits across experiments.** All experiments in a
   project share the same seeded validation split and test split
   (`splits.yaml` at the project root). Changing the split spec is
   a project-level decision — treat it as a breaking change and
   record it in `docs/decisions/NNNN-split-change.md`.

4. **Diagnostics specify which file.** Experiment Diagnostics
   sections default to `metrics.json`; any mention of
   `final_metrics.json` must say so explicitly.

## Open questions

- The rule is soft-specified: enforcement relies on the LLM honoring
  the rule in context plus `/lint` as backstop. A project that wants
  stronger guarantees can add pre-commit or CI checks that grep for
  `test/` access in the tool-call log.
- The right validation-split size is not specified. Too small and
  every iteration has high variance; too large and the test split
  shrinks. Projects should pick based on task-level noise and
  document the choice.
